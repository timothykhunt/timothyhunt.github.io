I analyse strategic interaction between adult siblings in the provision of care to
an elderly parent by estimating a dynamic discrete-choice game in which siblings
make location, work and care choices. I find that the opportunity for strategic
play exacerbates gender differences in caring responsibilities as sons in particular
strategically shirk providing care as they believe their sibling is relatively likely
to provide care in their absence. Counterfactual experiments show that if siblings
instead took care, location and work choices independently then the gender care gap
would be around 14% smaller. Also, I find that unobserved preference differences
between sons and daughters are far more important in driving the gender care gap
than observed differences in wages.
